The &amp;&amp;float Interactive Wall Installation Project 

Things you'll need for this to run: <br />
1. Processing (download from www.processing.org or from the dependencies folder) <br />
2. The Motion Tracking Library (plus: Quicktime; and WinVDIG 1.0.1 if you're using Windows). WinVDIG is in the dependencies folder with the Quicktime 7 setup, it can also be downloaded from http://www.eden.net.nz/7/20071008/ . Note that only version 1.0.1 will work, no other.<br />
3. A (Wide Angle) WebCam - faster the frame rate, the better - this works with regular VGA Cameras too, but performance may not be up to the mark <br />
4. A blank wall/flat surface <br />
5. A computer with Windows/Mac (Note: Mac testing has been limited and is not guaranteed to work yet.)<br />
6. A projector (to project the visualizations onto the wall) <br />


TODOs/Upcoming Wishlisted Features
-----------------------------------
1. Microsoft Kinect Support
2. Linux and Mac Platform Support
3. Projection Mapping Support
4. Porting the codebase to the more efficient Cinder/OpenCV/OpenFrameworks frameworks
5. Porting the system to (a) mainstream game engine(s) for cooler visualizations (e.g. Source SDK, Unreal, etc.)
