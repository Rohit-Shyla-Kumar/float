Processing (download from www.processing.org).\r\n2. The Flob Motion Tracking Library by s373 (plus: Quicktime; and WinVDIG 1.0.1 if you're using Windows). WinVDIG is in the dependencies folder with the Quicktime 7 setup, it can also be downloaded from http://www.eden.net.nz/7/20071008/ . Note that only version 1.0.1 will work, no other.\r\n3. A (Wide Angle) WebCam - faster the frame rate, the better - this works with regular VGA Cameras too, but performance may not be up to the mark.\r\n4. A blank wall/flat surface.\r\n5. A computer with Windows/Mac (Note: Mac testing has been limited and is not guaranteed to work yet.).\r\n6. A projector (to project the visualizations onto the wall).\r\n\r\n\r\n#####TODOs/Upcoming Wishlisted Features\r\n\r\n1. Microsoft Kinect Support\r\n2. Linux and Mac Platform Support\r\n3. Projection Mapping Support\r\n4. Porting the codebase to the more efficient Cinder/OpenCV/OpenFrameworks frameworks\r\n5. Porting the system to (a) mainstream game engine(s) for cooler visualizations (e.g. Source SDK, Unreal, etc.)\r\n\r\n\r\nDemo Video: [YouTube: Interactive Wall Installation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGoZktCzMS4)\r\n\r\n\r\nA project by Siddharth Mankad ([Twitter](https://twitter.com/smmankad)) and Sunil Vallu ([Twitter](https://twitter.com/sunilvallu)) <br />\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n######Licensing\r\n\r\nThis program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\r\nit under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\r\nthe Free Software Foundation, version 3 of the License, or\r\n(at your option) any later version.\r\n\r\nThis program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\r\nbut WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\r\nMERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
